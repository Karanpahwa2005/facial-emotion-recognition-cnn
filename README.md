A Deep Learning project that identifies human facial expressions from images. Using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained on the FER2013 dataset, the model can classify faces into 7 emotions: **Angry, Disgust, Fear, Happy, Sad, Surprise, and Neutral.**

This project demonstrates the end-to-end data science pipeline: data preprocessing, augmentation, CNN architecture design, and model evaluation.
